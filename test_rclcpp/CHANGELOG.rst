  In order to prevent tests breaking when the default logging format
  changes, let's set an explicit log format for these test executables.
* Adjusted spin_some test due to new behavior. (`#394 <https://github.com/ros2/system_tests/issues/394>`_)
  Previously would constantly trigger based on a 0ms delay timer;

  now adds multiple timers with a short delay to simulate performing
  work.
